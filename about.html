    <h2>My education background:</h2>
    <pre>
         I began my academic journey in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I completed my high
         school education with a strong foundation in mathematics and science. 
         Driven by a passion for technology and innovation, I moved to the United 
         States to further my studies in computer science. I earned both my Bachelor‚Äôs
         and Master‚Äôs degrees in Computer Science from East Texas A&M University. 
         During my undergraduate studies, I maintained a GPA of 3.72, demonstrating
         consistent academic excellence and a strong work ethic. I continued my 
         academic pursuit with a Master's degree, graduating with a GPA of 3.56. 
         Throughout my time at the university, I gained hands-on experience in 
         software development, data structures, cloud computing, and full-stack 
         application design. My education has not only equipped me with technical 
         skills but also instilled in me a lifelong curiosity and commitment to
         continuous learning.</pre
